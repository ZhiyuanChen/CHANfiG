Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.

The information we collect includes:

- **Identifiers.**

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information.

    - If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
    - If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records

## 6. How long do we keep your information?

!!! tip "In Short"

    We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 7. How do we keep your information safe?

!!! tip "In Short"

    We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## 9. Controls for Do-Not-Track features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised.
Although we cannot promise to honour every DNT signal, we strive to honour all such requests where technically feasible.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals.
Because we cannot guarantee to recognise and houour all DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
